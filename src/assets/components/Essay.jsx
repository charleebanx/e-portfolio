        <p>
          Hi! I’m Charlee and I am currently completing my B.S. in Information Science with a
          concentration in Web Development Technologies at the University of South Florida. I
          specialize in building responsive, accessible, and user-focused web applications using
          modern technologies. I also have experience in UI/UX design and IT, showcasing my
          versatility as someone who can approach projects from a technical and creative
          perspective. My passion lies in technology, music, and games, and I do my best to connect
          those interests with the ways I learn, build, and collaborate.

        <p>
          To know me more personally, I immigrated from the Philippines to the United States at age
          10. I lived in Palm Beach County, FL up until college where I moved to Tampa. I have
          always been an individual that loves technology, music, and games. If I’m not programming,
          designing, or reading up on technology, you can find me making music of all types,
          collecting records, or playing video games such as Apex Legends or Dungeon Defenders.
          These hobbies keep me creative and help me think about how entertainment and technology
          overlap in unique ways.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">Professional Experience</h2>
        <p>
          My professional experiences have helped me develop both technical expertise and valuable
          soft skills. At Mathnasium, I worked with K-12 students on subjects ranging from algebra,
          geometry, and calculus. Teaching math requires patience, attentiveness, and strong
          communication skills since I needed to explain complex topics in a way students could
          understand. I also regularly spoke with parents about their children’s progress, which
          strengthened my ability to communicate professionally.
        </p>
        <p>
          At theCoderSchool, I had the opportunity to work with K-12 students in a project-based
          learning environment. I guided them through coding projects using Java, Python, HTML, CSS,
          JavaScript, React and Lua. This role expanded my hands-on teaching experience along with
          my technical skills. I had to plan projects that matched students’ ideas and interests,
          which meant I had to think creatively and think which programming languages were fit for
          their wants, needs, and skills.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also gained startup experience at CODI, a small company focused on building a gamified
          app that teaches programming, similar to Duolingo. There, I expanded my UI/UX design
          skills by creating typography systems, color palettes, and transitions in Figma, and then
          building out the designs in React. I also contributed to the software development cycle by
          using Trello for task management and Confluence for documentation.

      <section className="mb-8">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">Current Role</h2>
        <p>
          Currently, I work at Tillys, where I continue to develop my customer-service and
          communication skills. I enjoy this job because it allows me to take my mind off academics
          while still building useful skills. I get to interact with people from all different
          backgrounds and it also continues to expand my skills in communication and adapting to a
          fast working environment.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">Future Goals</h2>
        <p>
          In the future, I plan to pursue careers in software development, web development and
          design, or IT. My academic background and professional experiences have prepared me for
          these roles by giving me the technical and soft skills they require. I have a strong
          foundation in programming, web technologies, and design, along with communication,
          teamwork, and adaptability. I am also committed to continuous growth by continuing to
          create more programming projects, UI/UX case studies, and planning to earn certifications
          such as CompTIA A+ and Network+ to strengthen my technical knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
          What excites me most about these career paths is the opportunity to create technology that
          is accessible, useful, and engaging. Software and web development allow me to combine
          creativity with problem-solving, while IT gives me a chance to support and maintain the
          systems that make technology work. No matter what path I take, I want to be part of
          projects and organizations that improve how people interact with technology.
